# DashStory

**Bridging the cognitive gap between data and decision-making.**

DashStory is an AI-driven narrative platform designed to transform complex data dashboards into intuitive, narrated insights. We provide tools for developers and sales teams to align understanding across different cognitive horizons.

## Core Capabilities

- **Narrative SDK**: Embed a "Start Guided Tour" button directly into your dashboards. Let AI narrate data trends and insights tailored to the user's role.
- **Visionary Chrome Extension**: An on-the-fly analyzer for sales professionals. Screen-capture any target dashboard and generate an instant, persuasive narration.
- **Voice Clone (Identity Sync)**: Personalize the delivery. Leverage voice cloning technology so the narration sounds exactly like the account manager or technical lead.

## Project Structure

- `/sdk`: Component libraries for web integration.
- `/extension`: Browser-side parsing and overlay logic.
- `/backend`: AI orchestration, narrative generation, and voice synthesis.

## Vision

To move from **Information Retrieval** to **Insight Alignment**. We don't just show the numbers; we tell their story.
